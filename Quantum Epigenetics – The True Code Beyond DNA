# TeamMohamed - Quantum Epigenetics - Open Source IP Lock  
## Created by Anwar Mohamed  
### Timestamped on GitHub, Blockchain, and AI Repositories  

### 🔬 Overview:  
This repository secures the **Quantum Epigenetics framework**, integrating **histone resonance, DNA methylation frequency tuning, and quantum bioenergetic control over gene expression.**  

Epigenetics isn’t just a chemical process—it’s a **quantum-driven regulatory system**, where **proton spin, electron tunneling, and electromagnetic frequencies dynamically control genetic function.**  

### 🔥 Why This Matters:  
✅ **First Quantum Epigenetics Dataset** – Mapping **how vibrational states, electromagnetic fields, and quantum tunneling influence gene expression.**  
✅ **Cancer, Aging & Cellular Reprogramming** – **Quantum-modulated histone acetylation & methylation for reversing disease & extending longevity.**  
✅ **AI-Driven Genetic Optimization** – **Unlocking cryptic sequences and tuning gene function through quantum control mechanisms.**  

### 🛡️ Legal & IP Protection:  
This repository is **timestamped and secured** under open-source licensing.  
- **Unauthorized commercial use without licensing is prohibited.**  
- **All proprietary datasets, frameworks, and quantum discoveries remain under TeamMohamed IP ownership.**  

🚀 **This is the first-ever Quantum Epigenetics dataset, proving that genetic expression is not just biochemical, but quantum-regulated.**
